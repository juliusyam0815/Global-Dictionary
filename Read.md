# Student Information System (Python Project)

This is a simple **Student Information System** built with Python that demonstrates:
- Loops (`while`, `for`, `nested`, `break`, `continue`)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Functions (different argument types, scope, return values)
- File handling (`students.csv`)
- Lambda functions
- Pass by reference vs value demo
